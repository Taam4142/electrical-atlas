## Claim-to-source mapping

| Claim ID | Lesson locator | Risk class | Supported claim | Sources | Verdict and limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V-C01 | EN/TH §1; route subtitle | Conceptual physics/metrology | Voltage is electric potential difference; `ΔV = ΔU/q`; `1 V = 1 J/C`; voltage compares two points. | S01, S02 | Verified. Wording uses electric potential energy, not generic “electric energy.” |
| V-C02 | EN/TH §1 and §6; demo intro/transcript | Conceptual physics | The height analogy uses a positive test charge; `ΔU = qΔV`, so sign depends on charge and direction. | S02 | Verified. Demo reports magnitudes and explicitly declares positive `q`. |
| V-C03 | EN/TH §4–5 | Conceptual circuits/fields | A field can exist without a closed conductor; a closed path permits sustained current, and a source maintains terminal potential difference. | S02, S05 | Verified within introductory electrostatic/lumped-circuit scope. |
| V-C04 | EN/TH §5 | Conceptual electromagnetism | Mobile carriers are already present throughout a metal conductor, respond to the operating field, and a load does not wait for one particular electron to traverse the complete circuit. | S05, S08 | Verified without publishing a propagation-speed comparison or treating carrier motion as the mechanism of field-mediated energy transfer. |
| V-C05 | EN/TH §6 and technical track | Technical physics | Signed energy relation, `𝐄 = -∇V`, bounded path integral, and nonconservative-field limitation. | S02, S03, S04 | Verified for electrostatic/conservative fields; limitation is visible. |
| V-C06 | EN/TH §7 | Measurement/safety | A voltmeter compares two points and is conceptually connected in parallel; finite input resistance loads the circuit slightly. | S07 | Verified. Immediate no-live-measurement boundary prevents the paragraph becoming a novice procedure. |
| V-C07 | EN/TH §2 and §10; demo model note | Safety | Voltage alone does not determine all shock, thermal, arc, burn, or fire risk; work on or near exposed energized parts needs task-appropriate qualification and controls; disconnected equipment may retain energy. | S09, S10 | Verified as general U.S. occupational-safety framing, explicitly not Thai law or a complete safe-work method. |
| V-C08 | EN/TH §2 | Component example | An alkaline AA cell may be labelled `1.5 V`, while operating voltage varies. | S11 | Verified only for the explicitly named alkaline chemistry/product class. |
| V-C09 | EN/TH §2 Thailand callout | Thai descriptive context | An ERC residential tariff note describes some meter categories at `230 V`, 1 phase, 2 wire. | S12 | Verified as a narrowly scoped tariff/service example. S13 is retained only as separate PEA product-scope context and is not evidence for this ERC claim; the lesson explicitly rejects a universal installation interpretation. |
| V-C10 | EN/TH §3 and §8 | Terminology/safety | Circuit ground/reference, chassis, Earth, and protective earth are not automatically interchangeable or safe. | S14, S15, S18 | Verified at conceptual terminology level; no earthing design or wiring instruction is provided. |
| V-C11 | EN/TH §9 | Failure modes | Excess field can cause breakdown; energy can remain stored; switching/parasitic inductance can cause spikes; floating conductors may show coupled potential. | S10, S15, S16, S17 | Verified as broad mechanisms. Exact limits, ratings, and diagnostic procedures are out of scope. |
| V-C12 | Demo component and physics helper | Equation/model behavior | Magnitude model uses `|ΔU| = |q||ΔV|`, returns zero energy at zero difference, deliberately holds the `+q` marker fixed because motion is not simulated, hides the field at zero, and scales to `24 V × 25 µC = 600 µJ`. The displayed `|ΔU|` is the hypothetical change across the full selected plate-to-plate `|ΔV|`. | S01, S02 | Verified conceptually; implementation/test and browser evidence are recorded separately below. |

## Corrections made during review

- Replaced “electric energy” with “electric potential energy.”
- Replaced the symbol collision `E = Vq` / electric field `E` with `ΔU = qΔV` and vector `𝐄`.
- Added the charge-sign and direction boundary to the height analogy and 9 V example.
- Explicitly distinguished change “from A to B,” `V_B - V_A`, from the “A relative to B” notation `V_AB = V_A - V_B`.
- Corrected the field/path explanation: a battery has terminal potential difference with an open circuit; closing a conducting path permits sustained current.
- Removed an unsupported surface-charge mechanism and narrowed the carrier-response explanation so it no longer makes an unnecessary propagation-speed claim.
- Added bounds and the electrostatic/conservative-field limitation to the path integral.
- Separated shock risk from high-current short-circuit, arc, burn, and fire hazards.
- Distinguished circuit ground/reference, chassis, Earth, and protective earth.
- Put the no-live-measurement warning directly beside the voltmeter paragraph.
- Removed the unsupported battery-specific low-voltage arc example and narrowed the qualified-work statement to work on or near exposed energized parts, with the U.S.-guidance/Thai-law boundary stated explicitly.
- Replaced the generalized Thai mains claim with a directly linked, narrowly scoped ERC tariff/service example and explicit limitation.
- Reworked the demo to hold the marker fixed while explicitly stating that motion is not simulated and that the displayed energy change is hypothetical across the full selected plate-to-plate difference.
- Added equal-potential/zero-field behavior, the positive-charge sign, high-to-low field direction, the real energy-bar maximum, and light-theme diagram colors that keep essential strokes at useful contrast.
- Added native range semantics, spoken value text with a meaningful live-output prefix, visible focus, touch-target sizing, localized interactive labels, scientific notation for electron count, and collision-resistant IDs.
- Made the spoken and visible energy values reuse one localized, rounded string so assistive output no longer exposes a floating-point artifact such as `89.99999999999999` for the visible `90 µJ` result.
- Corrected route metadata, removed the obsolete language-switch label prop, and aligned browser theme color with the current light theme.
- Removed the manually named “good next lessons” sentence; the relationship-driven suggestion section remains authoritative.

## Thai-language review preparation

The revision now uses:

- `พลังงานศักย์ไฟฟ้า` for electric potential energy;
- `ประจุทดสอบบวก` when sign convention matters;
- `จุดต่อ` in beginner prose and `โหนด` in the technical track;
- explicit distinctions among `กราวด์ของวงจร`, `โครงเครื่อง`, `ดิน`, and `สายดินป้องกัน`;
- `การทะลุทางไฟฟ้าของฉนวน`, `แรงดันพุ่งชั่วขณะ`, and other glossary-aligned terms used by this revision;
- `สมอ. / มอก.` in the correct TISI/TIS mapping order.

Final judgment of natural Thai wording belongs to the project owner and is still pending.

## Verification evidence

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused localized-number regression | Passed: English and Thai formatting tests both convert the real default-model artifact to the shared `90` display/announcement value. |
| Focused keyboard-value regression | Passed: Arrow, Home, End, Page, boundary, and unrelated-key cases cover the bounded range-value helper used by both Voltage sliders. |
| Full website test suite | Passed: 12 Node checks and 76 Vitest tests across 12 files. |
| Astro/type check | Passed: 92 files, 0 errors, warnings, or hints. |
| Production build and internal-link validation | Passed: 3,245 pages, 3,214 topic robots policies, and 3,246 unique root-relative references validated. |
| Desktop English/Thai visual check | Prior deployed candidate had no console errors and the English desktop layout had no horizontal overflow; corrected candidate recheck pending. |
| Mobile English/Thai visual check | Corrected deployed candidate passed narrow-layout overflow, single-column, language, title, 44 px range-target, and console checks in the 639 px browser viewport; manual visual confirmation remains part of the accessibility gate. |
| Native keyboard controls and visible focus | Corrected production candidate showed a visible focus outline, but Arrow/Home/End did not update either slider. Explicit bounded keyboard handling and `input` event support now pass focused tests; corrected deployment verification is pending. |
| Reduced-motion behavior | Source/code review passed; rendered reduced-motion verification remains pending. |
| Screen-reader-oriented names, live output, and transcript | Browser inspection found a raw floating-point spoken value on the prior candidate. Focused tests, built EN/TH HTML, and the corrected deployment now confirm `90` in the spoken text and `90 µJ` visually with no `89.99999999999999`; assistive-technology confirmation remains pending. |
| Deployed English/Thai pages | Commit `c581949` passed localized-output checks but is superseded by the keyboard/input correction; corrected deployment verification is pending. |

## Known limitations and review triggers

- This lesson explains voltage conceptually; it does not teach live measurement, installation, protection selection, or compliance.
- The parallel-plate visual is a deliberately simplified positive-test-charge model, not a literal wire-level circuit animation.
- Component label examples are illustrative; operating voltage varies with device, load, state, temperature, chemistry, and specification.
- The ERC `230 V` statement is limited to the residential tariff/service wording cited. It must not be reused as a universal Thai installation requirement.
- Add a qualified reviewer before adding exact shock thresholds, safe-working limits, test procedures, or Thai installation requirements.
- Set `sourceStatus` to `needs-update` if a cited source disappears, a Thai page or document changes scope, or the lesson expands beyond this evidence.

## Decision history

| Date | Decision | By | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-07-14 | Approve governance roles and begin Voltage pilot | Project owner | Approved process only; no lesson publication approval. |
| 2026-07-14 | Source, technical, English, Thai-preparation, and demo audit | Codex-assisted maintainer review | Corrections implemented; owner Thai review and browser/deployment evidence remain. |
| 2026-07-15 | Run revision-bound implementation gate | Maintainer automated verification | Tests, Astro diagnostics, production build, robots policy, and internal-reference validation passed; rendered browser review remains pending. |
